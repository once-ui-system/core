The `useResponsiveClasses` hook is an internal utility used by Flex and Grid components to manage responsive CSS classes based on breakpoints. It dynamically applies and removes classes as the viewport size changes.

**Used in components:** [Flex](/once-ui/components/flex), [Grid](/once-ui/components/grid)

<Feedback marginTop="16" marginBottom="24" description="This is an internal hook. You should never need to use this hook directly. Instead, use the Flex and Grid components with responsive props (e.g., `direction={{ s: 'column', m: 'row' }}`), which automatically handle responsive behavior."/>

## Features

- Automatic responsive class management
- Breakpoint-based class switching
- Optimized for performance
- Used internally by Flex and Grid

## Internal usage

This hook is used internally by the Flex and Grid components and is not typically used directly in application code.

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  codeHeight={24}
  lineNumbers
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`// Internal usage in Flex component
const useResponsiveClasses = ({
  elementRef,
  baseDirection,
  responsiveProps,
  breakpoints
}) => {
  // Manages responsive class application
  // based on window size and breakpoints
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Add/remove classes on resize
  }, [breakpoints]);
};`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Internal usage"
    }
  ]}
/>

## How it works

The hook:

1. Monitors window resize events
2. Compares current width against breakpoints
3. Applies appropriate CSS classes for the current breakpoint
4. Removes classes from other breakpoints

## Supported properties

The hook manages responsive classes for:

- `position` - static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky
- `direction` - row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse
- `horizontal` - justify-start, justify-end, justify-center, etc.
- `vertical` - align-start, align-end, align-center, etc.
- `overflow` - visible, hidden, scroll, auto
- `overflowX` - x-axis overflow
- `overflowY` - y-axis overflow
- `columns` - grid column count (1-12)
- `flex` - flex values (1-12)
- `wrap` - wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse

## Performance

The hook is optimized with:

- Debounced resize handling
- Efficient class manipulation
- Minimal re-renders
- Cleanup on unmount

## Related components

Used by:

- Flex
- Grid

## Example output

When a Flex component has responsive props:

<CodeBlock
  marginTop="16"
  marginBottom="24"
  codeHeight={12}
  lineNumbers
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`<Flex direction={{ s: 'column', m: 'row' }}>
  {/* Hook applies 'flex-column' on small screens */}
  {/* Hook applies 'flex-row' on medium+ screens */}
</Flex>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Responsive Flex"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Note

This is an internal hook. For responsive layouts, use the Flex and Grid components directly with responsive props rather than using this hook.
